-How do u handle dropdown
    first i will inspect and see what type of dropdown it is
    if html (nonselect), i ll just locate with any locator and click
    if it is <select> dd, i ll use Select class coming from Selenium library

-how do we get all of the options from a Select DD
    .getoptions method

-what is the return type
    List<WebElement>

-How do we get crrently selected opt
    .getfirstSelectedOption();
    this meth can be used to get the def val
    also can be used to get the value after selecting sth

Return type?
    Single WebElement

How do we select opts from a Select DD
    we can use 3 meths
        -selectByIndex
        -selectByValue
        -selectByVisibleText

Seyntax of how we handle Select DD
    1. we create an object of Select class
    2. we need to locate the DD <select> tag itself
    and pass it into Select constructor

        Select dromdownName = new Select(driver.findelement(By.LOCATOR));

    3. We can use the obj for handling DDs

        dropdownName.selectByVisibleText();

 ALERT

 what is an alert
    Some pop ups happening on the page
    developers use alerts to get users attention to deliver some content

how many alerts?
   1. HTML alert
        present inside of the <html> page as some web element
        there is noth spec abt this alert, we just locate and click

   2. JavaScript alerts
        we have 3 types of alerts

        1.Information/warning alerts
           user can ONLY accept

        2. confirmation
            user can accept and decline

        3. prompt alert
                user can accept and decline, and send keys

how do we handle alerts using Selenium
    i ll check the type of the alert
    JS alert, i ll use Alert from Selenium library

    Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();

    aler.accept();
    alert.dismiss();
    alert.sendkeys("string");

IFRAME

what is an iframe
    an iframe is HTML within another HTML page
    most of the time it is used to create indep sections
        in a page for adds, maps
         video content for anyth indep

 how do we handle
    selenium webDriver can focus on 1 thing at a time
        therefore we must SWITCH its focus from def <html> to iframe <html> before being able to do any actions inside of it

what happens if we dont switch to inner frame
    we ll get NOSUCHELEMENTEXCEPTION

how many ways we have to switch to inner frame
    1. by index
        -starts from 0
        we count

    2. by id-name value
        -we can just pass their values as string

    3. by locating it is a webelement
        - we locate the iframe tag itself as a webelement and pass into the method

    syntax:
        driver.switchTo().frame(WebElement);
        driver.switchTo().frame(driver.findElement(By.locator);

how do we go switch driver's focus to def iframe
    driver.switchTo().parentFrame();
    driver.switchTo().defaultContent();

1 <html>

2    <html>
3        <html> driver.switchTo().parentFrame(); --> will focus to #2
        </html> --> driver.switchTo().defaultContent(); -->#1
    </html>

     <html> --> driver.switchTo().parentFrame(); --> will focus to #1
    </html> --> driver.switchTo().defaultContent(); -->#1

<html>

The only time parentFrame() meth and defaultContent() meth will take difference in use is
    if we have a frame inside a frame
    otherwise if we have 1 layer of frame, they will both switch back to def html

--------------------

WINDOWS

is there a diff for Selenium to handle a new window or atab
    No

how does Selenium knows which wind is diff from which
    WindowsHandles

what is a window handle
    a randomly generated unique alphanumeric ID for each window

Every window has its own wind handle randomly generated by sel
    we dont have to do anyth spec for it

how do we get to the current window's handle
    .getWindowHandle();

what is return type
    String
    it ll capture and ret the current wind handle as a string

how do we get all of the currently opened windows'handles
    .getWindowHandles();

return type?
    Set<String>

    Sel will only ret the wind handles from the currnetly executed session

    Syntax: driver.switchTo().window(windowHandle);
