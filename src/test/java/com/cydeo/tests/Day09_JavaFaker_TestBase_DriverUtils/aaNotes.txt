1. Add dependency

a library that allows us to generate random data in an organized manner

---------------
Design pattern
general repetable solution

We ll use singleton design pattern
-guarantees to create same obj we want to create every time

1. create priv constructor
(closing any access to this class)

2. create getter setter to deliver the obj in the way we want to deliver
-in the utility method we ll create the logic below
    -if obj == null create new obj and return it
    -if obj not null, just return the obj
