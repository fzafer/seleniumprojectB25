-css slightly faster on just IE
-css easier to read and write

1. css cannot locate using text of webelements

2. css cannot find from matches base on index
xpath -> (pathformula) [indxnumber]

3. child to parent
//button/../  -> goes back to parent
By.xpath("//input[@class='xjdbof']//h3[.='checkbox'])"

xpath can do more than css but a little more complex
