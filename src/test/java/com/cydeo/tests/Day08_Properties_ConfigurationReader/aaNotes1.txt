what is test data
    data created or selected to satisfy the execution preconditions and inputs to execute one or more test cases

    AUT: application under test

Hard coding
keeping your data in ext source,
we are hardcoding some of the important test data

we put them and read them

we have go each by each to change

ex: working on env1, but it s down, what can we do with our existing structure
environments:
q01.vytrack.com
q02.vytrack.com
stagin1.vytack.com
stagin2.vytack.com
prod:. www.vytack.com


QA env: is generally used testing purposes
Staging env: also used for testing but generally has better server support etc.
prod: is actual product that end user is using

We are passing imp test data inside of .java class directly
this is HARDCODING
not scalable
not re-usable
not easy to maintain
not a good practice


common file types
Text, Excel
CSV file
Properties file: testData.
it stores data in KEY = VALUE pairs

browser = chrome
env = hettps://google.com
username= vtrvr
password: jnrejvv

.properties rules:

-data stored in key=value pairs
-there can only be 1 key with the same name
-we shouldpass the exact key

key=value is useful

1. key oart will be stored in .java classed so it will be hard coded
2. value stored in .properties, not hard coded

ins of writing passing some test data in every single class, we ll use:
configuration.properties

how to read from .prop file
-we need to use properties class. the objects of this class can read .pro files
Properties properties = new Properties();

-use FileInputStream class. allows us to read data from a file
FileInputStream file = new  FileInputStream("file.path");

after opening file stream using file path,
we load the file to the pro obj
properties.load(file);

4. once obj is loaded, we can get any value by passing key
properties.getProperty("browser")
