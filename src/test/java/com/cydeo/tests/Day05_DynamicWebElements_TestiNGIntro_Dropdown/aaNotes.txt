What is Xpath?
    one of 8 locators
    allows us to create custom locators
    we can use any attrib and any attr value to
    create our own custom locator
    can move from parent to child and child to parent

    use / to move directly to child
    use // to move to any child

    // : means jump to the point i will be giving or
    start from any point

    if there is more than 1 matching result, we use index to select which one we want

    <div id=1uh98">
    <a href= " google 1"
    <a href= " google 1"
    <a href= " google 1"
    </div

    //a[@href ='https://google.com'])[1]

    <div>
        <a href= " google 1"
        </div
           <div>
        <a href= " google 1"
          </div
                   <div>
        <a href= " google 1"
          </div
              </div
