.findElement(By.locator("STRING")
what does it do:
finds and returns a single web element
accepts locator parameter as String

what is return type
-Webelement type: comes from Selenium library

it throws NoSuchElement

what happens when exc is thrown in Selenium code execution
is it gonna execute the rest lines
Once it throws the exc, the rest of the lines will not be executed
unless we handle it

when we have NoC-Suchelement
-wrong locator
-synchronization: when browser driver and browser arent on same page,
driver fill try to find web element thats not located yet

.click()
clicks the given web element
it doesnt accept arg
driver.click();

driver.findelement().click();

.sendKeys();
pass the provided String into given WebElement

we can pass kKeys. command into sendKeys() methods as well

Keys.Enter:
imitates user pressing ENTER from keyboard

getText();
    get thecontent from in between the opening and closing tag
    String return type
    doesnt accept arg
    driver.findelement(locator).getText();
    ex: <a href="https://tesla.com" name="uh68" class="ff58" id="bb22"> TESLA CYBERTRUCK </a>
       --> TESLA CYBERTRUCK
